distribution
============

This package contains the module `Language.Curry.Distribution`
which contains definition of constants to obtain information
concerning the current distribution of the Curry implementation.

This package is deprecated and no longer required,
since the same functionality is available in the module
`Curry.Compiler.Distribution` of the `base` package.
