distribution
============

This package contains the module `Language.Curry.Distribution`
which contains definition of constants to obtain information
concerning the current distribution of the Curry implementation.

In principle, this package is no longer required since
the same functionality is available in the module
`Curry.Compiler.Distribution` of the `base` package.
